- **Stop Horn and Lights** - Deactivate horn and lights
- **Get Location** - Force location update

### Automation Integration

**Available Attributes for Rules:**
- `BatterySoC` / `battery` - Battery percentage
- `FuelLevel` - Fuel level percentage  
- `EVRange` - Electric range in miles
- `ChargingStatus` - "Charging" or "Not Charging"
- `DoorLock` - "locked" or "unlocked"
- `AirControl` - Climate control status
- `isHome` - true/false based on home location
- `Latitude` / `Longitude` - GPS coordinates
- `EstimatedChargeCompletionTime` - ISO timestamp for automations

**Example Rule Machine Uses:**
- Send notification when charging completes
- Turn on garage lights when vehicle arrives home
- Start climate control before departure time
- Alert if vehicle is left unlocked away from home

## Configuration Options

### App Settings
- **Username/Password** - Your Kia UVO Connect credentials
- **Debug Logging** - Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting
- **Auto-disable Debug** - Automatically turn off debug logging after specified minutes

### Device Settings
- **Climate Control** - Temperature, duration, heated accessories
- **Home Location** - Latitude, longitude, and radius for home detection
- **Auto Refresh** - Enable automatic status updates after commands
- **Refresh Delay** - Time to wait before auto-refresh (seconds)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Authentication Failures:**
- Verify your UVO Connect credentials
- Ensure your account doesn't have 2FA enabled
- Check that your vehicle is properly registered with UVO Connect

**Commands Not Working:**
- Try the "Poll Vehicle" command to get fresh status
- Check debug logs for specific error messages
- Ensure your vehicle has cellular connectivity

**Stale Data:**
- Use "Poll Vehicle" instead of "Refresh" for real-time data
- Increase the auto-refresh delay if commands seem to conflict

### Debug Logging

Enable debug logging in the app settings for detailed troubleshooting information. Debug logging will automatically disable after the configured time period to prevent log spam.
